teamBlockTitle: About us
aboutUs: Google's services have become synonymous with simple things online. Number
  of technological innovations and IT industries in which Google is creating new products
  is enormous. It's hard to get to know all of them, but realistic. This is why people
  have started to gather in small local groups and share their experience. Later,
  the following groups have been called Google Developer Groups. GDGs can take many
  forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch some videos, to large
  gatherings with demos, tech talks, hackathons and conferences.

- title: Android Wear
  image: hackathon-0.png
  details: The front doors will be locked because this is after hours, please park
    behind the building and come to the door nearest the parking lot.<br><br>Our last
    meeting showed that there was a lot of interest in Android Wear so we decided
    to put on an Android Wear Hackathon to see what you could come up with! We realize
    that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There
    will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with!
    Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else
    or maybe find inspiration once you're here!
- title: Google Glass
  image: hackathon-1.png
  details: 'We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to
    gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app
    on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid
    skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass
    Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing
    an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from
    the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new
    rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the
    most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience.'
- title: Polymer
  image: hackathon-2.png
  details: Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are
    small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications.
    The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore
    the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was
    also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless
    to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components
    in the design. We didnâ€™t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited
    time.
