      Putting yourself on the map means reaching out to all your potential customers, regardless of whether they use a keyboard or mouse, where they live, the language they speak or sign, or if they need a screen reader to use your app.<br>
      In this lightning talk, we'll run through a bunch of quick demos and show how to start preparing your Angular 2 app for people that come from all walks of life.<br>"
