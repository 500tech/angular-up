  title: "Managing Async With RxJS 5"
  description: "<p>Managing asynchrony in web applications is challenging: Ajax, web sockets, user events, animations. It's very easy to make mistakes and waste system resources, especially in single page applications.</p><p> In this talk, we'll identify some of the ways most applications are wasting resources while managing async with common abstractions like promises and callbacks. We'll then talk about what RxJS is, and what Observables are, and how they can help you remedy these problems in your application. We'll go over how RxJS 5 relates to Angular, and show why it's such a powerful tool.</p>"

  description: "<p>With the rest of the angular-ui/bootstrap team I've set
      out recently to migrate Bootstrap widgets to Angular 2. To my delight
      the resulting https://ng-bootstrap.github.io library offers much
      better APIs and was significantly easier to write as compared to the
      Angular 1 counterpart.</p>
    <p>During this talk I would go over specific
      patterns and tricks in Angular 2 that makes custom widget development
      a breeze. I want to focus on practical code examples that you can
      reuse while developing your own components and directives</p>"

    When it comes to Angular applications, good resolutions on performances mean faster and lighter.
    There is a number of technics which can improve speed: bundling, tree shaking, ahead of time compilation, lazy loading.
 </p><p>
    In this talk, we’ll learn more about each of them, and we’ll see them in action on a sample application

  title: "Building mobile apps with Angular 2 and NativeScript"
  description: "<p>NativeScript is a free and open source JavaScript framework for building native iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps. Add to that Angular 2.0 with TypeScript and you will get a truly amazing combination. But I know what you’re thinking: another way of building apps? What makes NativeScript special? Here are a few cool things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Direct access to native APIs—no plugins required. Want to create a file on Android? Run new java.io.File()—in JavaScript!</li>
      <li>Completely native performance through the use of a JavaScript bridge natively available on all three mobile platforms.</li>
      <li>Cross-platform libraries for common use cases. Need to call a JSON API? Run http.getJSON</li>
      <li>Style native apps using CSS. Yep, that’s actually a thing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Curious about how it all works? Come learn! Architectures will be explained; apps will be built; and fun will be had by all</p>"

  description: "
    <p>
      Angular 2 combined with RxJS, @ngrx/store, and Immutable.js is a fantastic platform for reactive web applications.
      If we then add hot loading and the Web Audio API to the mix, we have something truly exciting: A platform for reactive music creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk is about creating musical systems on the Angular platform.
      We’ll see how we can model an asynchronous process that generates music right there in the browser and allows the user to control it on the fly.
      It’s a really enjoyable way to learn reactive Angular application development.

      This means that the same application can be deployed to different environments like browsers, servers or even native devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk we will learn how to leverage this power using Angular Universal,
      and deploy our front-end SPA on the server without modification.<br>
      We will also learn how to avoid accessing environment specific functions, like direct DOM access, etc.

    Redux is a small library which introduces a unidirectional data flow and a predictable state container that scales.

      Angular 2 has a built-in support for running application logic inside a secondary web worker. Angular does the magic of marshaling requests between DOM and the application worker and let you focus on building super responsive UI components while enjoying the power of parallel code execution.

  title: "Reminiscing $compile: Compiling component's in runtime"
  description: "<p>
    Dynamic (or runtime) compilation was a native feature in angular 1 using the $compile service. This feature is \"most likely\" not available in your angular 2 application.
    </p><p>
      In this talk we will try to figure out what is that little price we pay when we choose AoT over JiT. In a dynamic compilation context, we will take a brief de-tour reviewing the compiler, understanding the performance penalties of runtime compilation and why AoT is preferred over JiT even if loosing the ability to dynamically create components.
    </p><p>
      We will clarify the difference between creating and instantiating components, how ComponentFactory and the Injector align, review approaches and code examples and go over scenarios where we might want to use it.
    </p><p>
      Just before giving up on JiT we will wonder off contemplating on futuristic ideas such as combining AoT, JiT & lazy loading for best of all world or maybe using the server as a compilation service...
