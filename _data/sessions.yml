  title: "Mad Science with the Angular Compiler"
  description: "
  <p>
    One of the most unique features of Angular is the way it performs change detection. The template of each individual component in the app gets transpiled to efficient JavaScript which makes the dirty checking algorithm “obviously fast”.
  </p><p>
    The fast change detection is not the only benefit we get from the template compiler! In this talk we’ll mix some mad science ideas with the Angular compiler and see where we can go!

  description: "<p>
    Taking over the world is not an easy challenge. It requires good strategy and a powerful army. What better soldiers than a mass of obedient robots? You just need a way to issue them instruction via their BLE interface.
  </p><p>
    But should you choose to build a web app or a native mobile app? With Angular you can do both; just add Web Bluetooth API to build a web app and NativeScript to build a native mobile app.
    Join this session to learn how it all works, to see how to get started, and to swear fealty to your new robot overlords.

    Dependency Injection is a core part of both versions of Angular, yet often times we take this ubiquitous part of the framework for granted, never considering how it works.
  </p><p>
    In this talk, we'll look under the hood of the dependency injection system, and learn how it does its job, and see some advanced ways to use it in our code.

    Adding animations or transitions to web components can be intimidating like hell. When it comes to Angular, animations are integrated in the Angular component making them less scary and much easier to apply.

    In this session we will get to know how to enable fancy animations and transitions in Angular.

  Your app is basically unusable. Whole populations will never even know you exist, and you're probably alienating many who do.
  </p><p>
  Putting yourself on the map means reaching out to all your potential customers, regardless of whether they use a keyboard or mouse, where they live, the language they speak or sign, or if they need a screen reader to use your app.
  </p><p>
  In this talk, we'll run through a bunch of quick demos and show how to start preparing your Angular app for people that come from all walks of life.

  title: "Automatic Progressive Web Apps using the Angular Mobile Toolkit"
  description: "<p>
  Progressive Web Apps are the next big thing for the web. They combine the advantages of two platforms: <p> searchability and shareability of the web with capabilities and performance of native mobile. As a result, web developers can use their favorite tools to build installable, re-engageable, connectivity independent apps, that can bring native-like performance and user experience.
  </p><p>
  The Angular Mobile Toolkit makes it easy to get started building PWA. It’s developed to automate main routines and provide us with some nice tools to control the progressive app behavior. During this practical session, we'll have a look at Mobile Toolkit’s main components, and how they take our web app to the next level. With just some simple updates we’ll get installable, offline-capable, mobile-network-friendly Angular app re-engaging users by push-notifications.
  </p><p>
  This topic could be presented in a form of training/workshop (preferable)
