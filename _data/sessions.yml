  title: "Web Is The New Native"
  description: "2018 is the year we start to really bet fully on the web. There is a new web API every other month and browser vendors now see implementing browser API features not just as a way of keeping up to date, but also as a competitive space for getting more users to adopt their browsers. It seems every native feature out there is getting a corresponding Web feature being implemented. This talk focuses on the very simple yet somewhat challenging things that when it comes to implementing specific features on the web. Some of the features include taking pictures with camera devices, accessing video streams Instagram style, accessing user geolocation Uber-Style, offline support for PWA applications and loads of other features. The question this talk aims to answer is can you build apps with really native features with just web technologies today?"

  description: "NGRX is more than just a state management library for Angular. Instead, it is a set of tools that helps us implement a lean version of a full-blown messaging system. During this session we will learn how to program with messages, the design patterns that we can use and a language that we can use for designing and implementing our next system. "

  title: "Web animations & state: The secrets for a successful relationship"
  description: "<p>
   As you’re developing your app and adding animation you soon begin to realize that even a small set of simple animations can get complex really fast. By now we’ve become really good at abstracting logic, breaking our apps into components and managing the flow of app state. How do animations fit in all of this though?
   Unlike state changes which can be instantaneous, animations inherently take time to complete. They may be stopped, queued or interrupted but they must always, always maintain coherency for the user. In this talk we’ll discuss the theory of managing state-based animation, orchestrating animations across different components and animation UX using JS and CSS.</p>"

  title: "Can’t touch this! The right way to work with DOM in Angular and things to avoid"
  description: "<p>Do you know why you should prefer using Renderer and ViewContainerRef over directly manipulating the DOM? Loads of developers ask this question themselves every day when implementing complex UI manipulation logic. Alas, due to the scarcity of information on the topic many developers don’t have a clear understanding of the tools introduced on top of the pure DOM. This talk brings you on an exciting journey into the architecture of the Angular’s view layer. Using a few common cases we’ll learn how to apply familiar concepts via tools that Angular provides to work with the DOM. We’ll see some surprising consequences of not using these tools. The topics covered in this talk will help you build a coherent mental model and turn you into an Angular DOM manipulation ninja.

  description: "<p>Some developers believe that Angular has different types of modules like shared, feature or routing module. They’d be surprised to learn that Angular has none. Using a simple application, this talk will demonstrate how Angular uses a compiler to merge all modules into a single injector. We’ll learn where lazy loaded modules fit into this picture and why modules hierarchy and encapsulation simply don’t exist at runtime. By the end of the talk, you’ll have enough knowledge to avoid unexpected results and will be able to link, load or compile modules like a pro. </p>"

  title: "Sharing Code Between Web and Mobile Native Apps"
  description: "NativeScript has opened up a whole new world to Angular developers: the ability to share code directly between your web and native iOS/Android applications. Which is awesome! But, there are various things that we need to take care of in order for that to be possible. We will look into the structure of a code sharing project. Then into techniques of splitting code between web and mobile. And finally, we will look into migration of existing web or NativeScript projects to a code sharing structure. Come for practical tips & tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments and to see how we’ve extended Angular CLI with Schematics to make it all a breeze."

  description: "\"Yeah, we do want to write tests, just not now, right after this next release... we promise...\"
  Hi, My name is Shai Reznik and I've got an interesting business opportunity to discuss with you.
  In the end of the day we all want to feel confident in our code stability and design and make changes without the fear of breaking something.
  But getting started with testing is hard, and testing Angular apps can be confusing and overwhelming. 
  In this talk I'll share with you a few secrets that will jump start you on your way to testing success, a great love life, worldwide fame and a multi billion company with lots of profits and money! 
  But mostly testing success...
  and money.
  and a hug
  no? 
  why not?
  common... 
  There you go!
  That was a good hug!
  now you can go... 
  go I tell you, go have fun!
  Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
  Just come and watch my talk and convince 10 other people to watch it too. 
  In the meantime, as a preparation, watch the free TDD theory course on HiRez.io
  OK, Bye!
  Mom."

  description: "In this talk, I will share tips and tricks for building powerful components with lifecycle hooks, templating techniques, and practical use cases. We’ll go beyond the most well-known and commonly-used strategies: what lies beyond ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy, inputs, and outputs? We’ll learn how and when to use other lifecycle hooks to monitor and manipulate component templates. I’ll dig into template reference variables, NgIfElse, declarative templating with the async pipe, view children, and more. Go deeper with components in this talk and come out knowing how to leverage more advanced techniques in your Angular applications!"

  description: "One of the challenges of using the Redux (ngrx) architecture for a large, complex application is deciding how to model the state object. We will dive into what types of data should be kept in the state (hint: there's no \"right\" answer), why it should be normalized, and how to organize state to reduce duplicate and nested data and keep reducer logic simple."

  title: "Angular - Maps - Users of Apps"
  description: "Maps, today, are an essential of the internet. Think of any app, and you will realize that it uses a map either to just display a location, or visualize data. Most of these apps, however, also use that map as a user interface, where the user can enter their location and receive corresponding, location based services or suggestions. Take for example car services apps (Uber, Beat), dating apps (Tinder), search-and-discovery apps (Foursquare), or any social app (Facebook, Twitter).
  In this presentation we will see how to create an Angular app that uses the Google Maps JS API and Firebase to match users together according to their chosen location! We will learn about Angular integration with Google Maps, user input on Google Maps and Angular and data display on Google Maps (the user generated data). The presentation will be interactive and engaging, since participants will be prompted to input their location and see the results live on the big screen. We will see code and examples and discuss implementation techniques. "
