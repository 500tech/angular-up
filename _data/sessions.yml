  <p>
    One of the most unique features of Angular is the way it performs change detection. The template of each individual component in the app gets transpiled to efficient JavaScript which makes the dirty checking algorithm “obviously fast”.
  </p><p>
    The fast change detection is not the only benefit we get from the template compiler! In this talk we’ll mix some mad science ideas with the Angular compiler and see where we can go!

    Taking over the world is not an easy challenge. It requires good strategy and a powerful army. What better soldiers than a mass of obedient robots? You just need a way to issue them instruction via their BLE interface.
  </p><p>
    But should you choose to build a web app or a native mobile app? With Angular you can do both; just add Web Bluetooth API to build a web app and NativeScript to build a native mobile app.

  title: "Reactive State Management For Your Angular App"
  description: "<p>Your Angular application is a reactive system. It reacts to different events and updates the model, then propagates the changes through the component tree. It works like a charm for the simple and non UI-intensive apps. But when you, following this architecture, meet some more complex usecases (like concurrent data modification, complex component intercommunications, the need to keep temporary UI state, etc), it's time to think about different way to manage the app state. Redux pattern to the rescue! But Redux in Angular way. We have reactive forms, reactive router, observables-based http-client, so let's have a look at reactive Redux called ngrx/store. In this session: intro to the state management (famous Facebook bug), base principles and components of Redux, converting our regular app to the one using centralized store using ngrx/store, tooling, pros and cons of having centralized store for the state management.

  title: "The web in an era of smart devices"
  description: "<p> The improvements in size, features and price of hardware has ushered new opportunities in creating small, smart devices (aka internet-of-things) which can be integrated in homes and industries. In these places, the devices can help automate common tasks, as well as give information about the state of things, such as temperature of a machine, air quality etc.
  </p><p>
  Installing an app for one such devices might seem fine at first, but it doesn’t scale nicely to 100s of devices, or devices you seldom interact with, like in an industrial setting. Devices might even have different security restrictions, like being locked behind a physical key.
  </p><p>
  So how do we communicate with these devices? The web has always been known for its low fraction and easy on-boarding. No need to install any software, just type in a URL and off you go. And it has always been very secure with its sandbox system, and companies can even have URLs be restricted to certain WiFi networks (intranet).
  </p><p>
  Come join me for a look at how the web can make your smart devices success </p>"
